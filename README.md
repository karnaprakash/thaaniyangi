# thaaniyangi

This side project is basically automating few of the stuffs in my life, starting from  personal finance, housekeeping stuffs and so on.

I am starting with personal finance, basically information on stock markets and analysis of the price of few stocks which i follow and send
snippets to my telegram app to start with.

This is completely done on Golang, being a python and shell scripter for quite a long time, Golang seems to a be interesting choice for scripting and devops projects, 
so thought i could tinker with golang for the personal side project.

Thaaniyangi is a tamil word for automaton.
